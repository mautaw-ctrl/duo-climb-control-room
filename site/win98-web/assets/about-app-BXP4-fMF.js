## Background

This project started as a small experiment to give my portfolio website a Windows 98 theme. As I explored many WebOS UI and filesystem libraries and dabbled with LLM agents like Google Jules, that experiment gradually grew into a full browser‑based desktop environment.

Over time, it became a challenge: to push how far a **vanilla JavaScript application** (no React, Vue, or Angular) could go, to explore OS‑like UI structures in the browser, and to test my ability to design and sustain a larger, long‑running personal project. It's also my opportunity to experience collaboration with LLM AI and test their limits.

**Why Windows 98?** The main inspiration for this is actually my (parents') first computer ever, a Windows 98 machine. It is my first experience with a computer, and I remember the excitement of tinkering with it. That feeling is what I'd like for you to experience as well. 

## What You Can Do Here

* Explore a browser-based desktop that behaves like a classic operating system.
* Change themes, colors, wallpapers, and sound schemes to customize your experience.
* Run classic games and utilities in an authentic retro environment.
* Create, edit, and manage files in a persistent virtual file system.
* Mount local folders and .ISO files as virtual drives (A:, D:, etc.) to work with your real files.
* Install the project as a Progressive Web App for offline access.
* Chat with an AI-powered assistant for help and nostalgia.

## Applications Included

Windows 98 Web Edition includes a growing collection of built-in applications. These range from games and media players to productivity tools and system utilities.

### Games & Entertainment
* **Windows Games**: Solitaire, FreeCell, Minesweeper, Spider Solitaire, remade from scratch. There's also Pinball Emscripten port available.
* **Classic DOS Games**: Doom, Quake, Diablo, Prince of Persia, SimCity 2000, Commander Keen (via emulation). Yes, it can play Doom.
* **Media Players**: Winamp (via Webamp), Media Player, Flash Player.

### Productivity & Accessories
* **Text Editors**: Notepad, WordPad.
* **Graphics**: Paint, Image Viewer.
* **Utilities**: Calculator, PDF Viewer.

### System Tools
* **File Explorer** with full file management and virtual drive support.
* **Task Manager** for monitoring running applications.
* **MS-DOS Command Prompt** with common DOS commands (DIR, CD, MD, DEL, COPY, etc.).
* **Display Properties & Desktop Themes** for theme and appearance customization.
* **Disk Defragmenter** (visual simulation, not real defragmentation).
* **Help & Report A Bug**.

## 🐞 Bug Reporting

We want to make Windows 98 Web Edition as stable and authentic as possible! If you encounter any issues, please let us know.

### **The Preferred Way: GitHub Issues**
For the best tracking, please report bugs directly on our GitHub repository. This allows the community to discuss, track, and fix issues transparently.

👉 **[Report a Bug on GitHub](https://github.com/azayrahmad/win98-web/issues/new/choose)**

### **In-App Reporting**
If you don't have a GitHub account, you can also use the **Report a Bug** application within the OS (Start → Programs → Accessories → Report a Bug). Note that these reports are anonymous and we may not be able to follow up with you directly.

### Special Features
* **Assistant (Clippy)**: An intelligent assistant that can answer questions and help navigate the system.

A complete and up-to-date list of applications, including development notes and how to create your own apps, is available here:

📄 **[Application Development Guide](./src/apps/README.md)**

## For Developers and Tinkerers

This project is designed to be forked, studied, and experimented with. The codebase is structured to be modular and extensible.

**Key Features for Developers:**
* Applications are registered dynamically through a central configuration system.
* Apps can be window-based (traditional GUI apps) or function-based.
* Context menus, menu bars, and keyboard shortcuts are easily configurable.
* Themes and visual styles are data-driven.
* Virtual file system with persistent storage (IndexedDB) allows for real file operations.
* Event-driven architecture with a global \`window.System\` API.

**Creating Your First App:**

\`\`\`javascript
import { Application } from '../../system/application.js';

export class HelloWorldApp extends Application {
  static config = {
    id: 'hello-world',
    title: 'Hello World',
    width: 400,
    height: 300
  };

  _createWindow() {
    const win = new window.$Window({
      title: this.title,
      width: this.width,
      height: this.height,
    });
    win.$content.append('<div style="padding: 20px;">Hello from Windows 98!</div>');
    return win;
  }
}
\`\`\`

For detailed instructions, see the **[Application Development Guide](./src/apps/README.md)**.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

* **System Core** (\`src/system/\`): Handles the fundamental "OS" logic.
  * \`os-init.js\`: Boot process and system initialization.
  * \`window-manager.js\`: Window lifecycle and z-index management.
  * \`app-manager.js\`: Application registration and launching.
  * \`zenfs-init.js\`: Virtual file system configuration.

* **Shell** (\`src/shell/\`): Desktop environment components (Taskbar, Start Menu, Desktop, Explorer).

* **Applications** (\`src/apps/\`): Individual applications decoupled from the core system.

* **Global API**:
  * \`window.System.launchApp(appId, data)\`: Launch applications programmatically.
  * \`window.fs\`: Access the virtual file system (ZenFS).
  * \`window.mounts\`: View currently mounted file systems.

### Virtual File System

Uses **ZenFS** to provide a Unix-like file system in the browser:

* **Root (/)**: InMemory file system, containing mount points for other drives.
* **C: Drive (/C:)**: Persistent storage (IndexedDB). Data survives browser restarts.
* **A:, D:, E:, etc.**: Can be used to mount local folders (via File System Access API) or ISO images.

## AI Assistant

Clippy is reintroduced as an optional, AI-powered assistant that provides contextual help and guidance.

**How It Works:**
* Launch the **Assistant** app from the Start Menu or Desktop.
* Type your question or request in natural language.
* Clippy processes your input using a language model backend.

**Privacy Note**: Conversations with Clippy are sent to a backend API for processing. The backend service lives here:
👉 **[resume-chat-api](https://github.com/azayrahmad/resume-chat-api)**

## Technologies Used

### Core Technologies
* **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, and CSS3.
* **Runtime & Package Manager**: [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for lightning-fast development (Node.js/NPM no longer required).
* **Build Tool**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (optimized with Bun).
* **Virtual File System**: [ZenFS](https://zenfs.dev/) for persistent storage.

### UI & Styling
* [98.css](https://jdan.github.io/98.css/): For authentic Windows 98 styling.
* [os-gui](https://os-gui.js.org/): For core desktop GUI components (locally modified).

## Running Locally

\`\`\`bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/azayrahmad/win98-web.git
cd win98-web

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start the development server

\`\`\`

## Future Roadmap

* [ ] **Theme Installation**: Allow users to install custom themes (.theme/.themepack/.reg).
* [ ] **More Screensavers**: Recreate more Windows 98 Plus! screensavers.
* [ ] **Virtual Floppy**: Implement virtual floppy disk image support (create & mount).
* [ ] **WinZip**: Add WinZip to extract zip files with ZenFS Archive.
* [ ] **Migration and Backup**: Implement migrating C: drive to local folder and creating backup.
